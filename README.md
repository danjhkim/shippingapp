# Shipping and Package APP

My React App is a web application built with React, SCSS, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Saga. The app tracks user profiles and displays information about their orders. The application is fully typed with TypeScript and uses Axios for making API calls to the backend server.

## Node Version

**Note: If you get errors, please ensure you are using a compatible version of node. You can download nvm to change node versions**

Works with node v18.14.2

## Installation

To install My React App, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by running:

npm install

### Usage

You can run My React App by running:

npm run start

This will start the application on http://localhost:3000.

### Build

You can also build the application by running:

npm run build

This will create a production-ready build in the build directory.

### Eject

npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
